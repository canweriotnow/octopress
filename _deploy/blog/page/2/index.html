  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a long time, Jason Fried&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html">Why I Run a Flat Company</a> has seemed like an unrealistic dream that only works in rarified pockets of hacker utopia.</p>

<p>You have to understand, I work for an institution which, between the university, hospital(s), and various other divisions, employs over 40k people, enrolls over 20k students, treats countless patients, and who knows how many vendors and contractors add complexity to the mix.</p>

<p>But I still think there&#8217;s something to this &#8220;flat company&#8221; idea. My team is a bit of an oddity, and I think that&#8217;s what allows us to be agile and innovative in a way that&#8217;s impossible for most of the other software teams. The team is, on an org chart, pretty much flat. We have a team lead, to whom we <em>don&#8217;t</em> report (on paper).</p>

<p>Let me backtrack a bit. In interest of full disclosure, I do have a bit of a cognitive bias in favor of flat organizations. My lefty politics tend toward anarchist-communism, so I have a certain degree of distrust for <em>any</em> hierarchy. I think this goes back to the important distinction between <em>having</em> authority and <em>being an</em> authority. The difference between a bestowed, arbitrary power, and the innate power of being intelligent, capable, and well-informed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m finally reading <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com">Chad Fowler</a>&#8217;s excellent book, <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a>, and in it he recounts an experience that was chillingly familiar.</p>

<p>A music major, Chad fell into working at his university&#8217;s IT department as if by accident. Initially, he was worried that his lack of professional experience or training would prove an embarrassment; after all, here he was working alongside people with advanced degrees in computer science.</p>

<blockquote><p>Within a few days of work, the truth started to sink in. These people don&#8217;t know what the hell they&#8217;re doing! In fact, some people were watching me work and taking notes! People with master&#8217;s degrees in computer science!</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="float-left" src="/images/passionate-programmer.png"></p>

<p>I can definitely relate. I work at a university as well, and it&#8217;s actually my first formal software development position. I&#8217;ve been coding as part of my job (and my full-time hobby) for years&#8230; as far back as high school, in fact. I learned BASIC on a Texas Instruments 99/4A when I was 4 or 5. But prior to this, my paid software development work had either been freelance stuff or encountering a problem in a non-technical job that I could solve faster by hacking something together.</p>

<p>I work on a small team on which I&#8217;m the only full-time developer (I&#8217;ll come back to this later). Recently, IT had a major re-org which put my team under a new director and in the same organizational unit as a large team of developers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post isn&#8217;t meant to play into some hacker holy war, nor is it intended to denigrate the usefulness of Python for various tasks. Steve Yegge has done <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel">a much better job than I can</a> of explicating some of the issues other programmers have with Python, both the language and the community around it; I still agree with his remarks there.</p>

<p>But there <em>are</em> some (major, IMHO) issues with the &#8220;Pythonic&#8221; attitude toward programming. And they start with &#8220;The Zen of Python.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Zen of Python</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like about <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a>. On the first face of it, it&#8217;s a pretty good set of principles:</p>

<pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</code></pre>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot here that would be attractive, if not obvious, to any given Rubyist or Clojurian. I think the problem is that Pythonistas tend to get hung up on the <em>bad</em> elements of the &#8220;Zen of Python&#8221;, to the detriment of the positive ones. So I&#8217;ll just go through some of the ones that cause the most friction with non-Pythonistas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I wanted to plug a little project that <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/micahjgates">Micah Gates</a> and I hacked together at <a href="http://railsconf.austinonrails.org/bohconf">BohConf</a>, the awesome un-conference and hackfest that runs parallel to <a href="http://railsconf2012.com">RailsConf</a> each year.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/ruby-jokes/job_interview">job_interview</a>, and it&#8217;s a Ruby gem to automate some of the tedium of programmer job interviews.</p>

<p>As an example, let&#8217;s take <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">FizzBuzz</a>, a typical interview screening question intended to weed out the applicants who can&#8217;t write code to save their lives. In Ruby, you might implement FizzBuzz like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>FizzBuzz </span><a href='https://github.com/ruby-jokes/job\_interview/blob/master/lib/job\_interview/fizz\_buzz.rb'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>

<p>But that&#8217;s just tedious. With job_interview, it&#8217;s dead simple:</p>

<p>It also does Fibonacci sequences (recursive, iterative, and matrix strategies), a quine, the first <em>n</em> primes, and, of course, &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221;</p>

<p>That wasn&#8217;t enough, though.</p>

<p>&#8230;and many more.</p>

<p>We aim for 100% test coverage with RSpec, so we&#8217;re confident that this is a robust solution for a range of job interview scenarios.</p>

<p>We did a lightning talk at RailsConf 2012, and you can <a href="http://ruby-jokes.github.com/job_interview/pres.html">see the slides here</a>.</p>

<p>Next time you face an interview for a programming job, work smarter, not harder.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Machine Beauty</h3>

<p><img class="float-left" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1171573120l/107615.jpg" width="250"></p>

<p>In his essay <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107615.Machine_Beauty">Machine Beauty</a>, David Gelernter defines &#8220;machine beauty&#8221; as an inspired mating of simplicity and power. In software, I think this is also what we mean when we talk about &#8220;elegance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dijkstra quote that serves as a tagline for this blog is actually truncated; the full quote reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a quality that decides between success and failure.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not (necessarily) an economic truth; few people would describe any product from Microsoft as elegant, but they have been economically successful. However, the painful experience of using Microsoft software, the unreliability of both systems and applications, the general clunkiness of Windows applications, indicates that the software here is indeed a failure.</p>

<p>Software is a failure when it becomes an obstacle to productivity rather than an aid to it; when you must serve the compiler (or interpreter) rather than the compiler serving you (think Java boilerplate). From an end-user standpoint, the failure comes when the interface imposes unnatural workflows and ceremony that interrupts the natural flow of completing a task.</p>

<p>Software is successful when you hardly notice it&#8217;s there; when it becomes a natural extension of the self, an augmentation to human ability. In terms of systems, think of the Macintosh when it was introduced; nothing before had been so intuitive, and enabling. In terms of programming languages, Ruby leaps immediately to mind. It is so expressive that it no longer feels like &#8220;coding&#8221;; you are just expressing your thoughts in a syntax that feels almost immediately as natural as a spoken language.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to retire my old blog, which had devolved into a platform for rants rather than anything truly worthwhile&#8230; to me, anyhow. Sure, my rants were amusing at times, and people seemed to enjoy them, but that&#8217;s not the point of blogging for me.</p>

<p>I want to talk about things that really matter, which (for me) includes simple, powerful code that works the way it is intended to.</p>

<p>So, trying this blogging thing again.</p>
