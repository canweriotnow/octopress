    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I conceived of this post, it was going to be about how damn awesome <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is. And it certainly is awesome; it powers this blog, and makes writing it a joy, whereas trying to use <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, or even newer alternatives like <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> or <a href="http://postero.us">Posterous</a> was downright painful. But what I'm more interested in is the growing trend among apps, services, and even operating systems that has made projects like Octopress necessary.</p>

<h3>The Tragedy of Google</h3>

<p>For such a long time, Google did search better than many of us ever dreamt <em>possible</em> in the pre-Google days. But it wasn't just the intelligence of the search algorithms, or the massive cache and index behind Google search. Google made it possible to craft a finely-honed query from the front page, with excellent support for literal strings, boolean operators, required inclusion/exclusion, etc. And then came Google+.</p>

<p>Google's commitment to search had been on the decline for a while, it seems... the only new features search had acquired in years were fairly useless things like page previews and, briefly, Twitter integration. Because that's integral to search.</p>

<p>But when Google launched its abortion of a social network, usable search had to go. Not only did they kill one of the <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/3oIWbew9xdE">most useful search operators</a> (Boolean +), but they also started filtering search results based on social connections in Google+. While this doesn't <em>always</em> end in having to re-search without "personal" results, I have a feeling that's only because I'm connected to so many developers on Google+. But if Google+ hadn't been such an abject failure, my mom might be on there, and we typically search about very different kinds of "cookies."  The situation with Google is so bad at this point, that I often get better results from <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>, which wraps a ton of different search engines and websites, and attempts to break the "filter bubble" by presenting hte same results to everyone. I like this in principle, but I miss Google's synchronized search history and habit of learning what results are relevant to me to (usually) provide better results.</p>

<h3>Blogging for Hackers</h3>

<p>So, let's face it: unless you wanted to host your own blog, and either write your own engine, or tweak one into submission, keeping an attractive, maintainable, and useful blog was either an expensive or losing proposition. Sadly, this isn't a recent change like the other phenomena addressed in this post, but it's still an issue.</p>

<p>What's slightly alarming is the trend away from traditional blogging engines like Wordpress and Blogger, which, while not exactly hacker-friendly, were oriented toward content creation. The newer generation of blogging services are much more oriented toward the re-posting of content. While I'm okay in principle with re-posting (and I think "remix culture" is awesome), when your priority is saturation with "viral content" rather than the creation of OC, it makes it easy to ignore the creation of tools which lend themselves to the creation of content.</p>

<p>Octopress is awesome because it doesn't try to be everything to everybody. Billed as "A blogging framework for hackers," Octopress is basically a set of <code>rake</code> tasks and plugins for <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid">Liquid</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, all wrapped up with the tasty goodness of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator that powers <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this means I can use my favorite text editor (lately, either <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, depending on my mood) to create my posts in Markdown, Textile, or Haml, and have Octopress generate pretty-styled HTML, CSS and JS, and deploy my blog to Github Pages (or Heroku) with a rake task. Even for non-programming power users, or anyone frustrated with Wordpress, really, Octopress is worth checking out.</p>

<h3>Apple to Developers: "Go Fuck Yourselves"</h3>

<p>Okay, slight hyperbole. But it feels that way sometimes. I've been using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> on OS X for Ruby (and Perl, and C, and Clojure, you get the picture...) for such a long time now, that I'm <em>really</em> loathe to change my workflow. Even though, conceptually, I prefer the idea of using Linux on all the things. But since Apple is now <em>blatantly</em> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/features.html">trying to turn my worsktation into a tablet</a>, I'm forcing myself to use the <a href="http://lubuntu.org/">Lubuntu</a> box sitting next to my iMac as much as possible.</p>

<p><img class="float-right" src="/images/post-img/mtlion1.png" width="400"></p>

<p>It's not just the "aesthetic" changes that chafe. I can deal with <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/">annoying UI crap</a>, especially when it's optional. But Apple is also changing the developer ecosystem, first with the Mac App Store, then with Gatekeeper, which will warn against installation of software not signed with an Apple developer account by default. It has been pointed out that this behavior is fairly straightforward to alter, but I still find the whole process dubious and, for me at least, it's another straw on the OS X camel's back. I'm not arguing that no one should use OS X, I'm just saying it's less and less attractive to me as a development platform.</p>

<p>The whole allure of OS X was that it was a stable, supported, POSIX-compliant operating system that was enjoyable to use but afforded the user all of the power and flexibility of Unix. It looks like those days are over, and the days of creating powerful tools for developers and designers to create whatever they could imagine are over. The Mac is turning into an overpowered tablet, suited for content consumption rather than creation.</p>

<p>Apple is not alone in its efforts to neuter the desktop. Not to be outdone in locking down the OS and polluting the developer ecosystem, Microsoft is scrambling to release Windows 8 so that Windows users can be as disoriented as possbile. Although there are <a href="http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2012/05/fear-and-loathing-and-windows-8.html">good</a> <a href="http://pcunix.hubpages.com/hub/Why-Windows-8-might-Kill-Microsoft">arguments</a> that Windows 8 holds the threat of finally toppling the waning Microsoft hegemony, I'm actually jealous of Windows 8 in one way: Windows 8 includes an almost-workalike Windows 7 compatibility mode. I <em>wish</em> Lion had a "act like Snow Leopard" mode. Although one of the articles I just cited laments the loss of the Start menu in Win7 mode, I don't think it's that much of a loss, if PowerShell is still included (or better yet, Cygwin).</p>

<p><img class="float-left" src="/images/post-img/win8-1.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>I use Windows as little as possible, so I'm less annoyed about Windows 8 than I am Lion. But the trend is disturbing, and is even being echoed to a degree (a greatly diminished degree) in <a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">GNOME 3</a> and <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Unity</a>. But on Linux, at least, I have the option of using whatever window manager and desktop environment works best for me (or none at all).</p>

<p>I realize that commercial operating system vendors need to target the widest possible user base. But the much-ballyhooed rise of the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2011/12/05/the-rise-of-developeronomics/">developer-centric economy</a> would <em>seem</em> to suggest that pissing off developers is a <em>bad</em> idea. Apple and Microsoft spent the better part of the 1980's and 1990's competing not only for market-share, but for developer mind-share. The movement toward locking us into proprietary toolchains and ecosystems (XCode for Apple, VisualStudio for Microsoft) looks like little more than a cynical attempt to chain down developers in a walled garden. Hopefully, we don't fall for it.</p>

<h3>For Us, By Us</h3>

<p>It's been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Linux#Year_of_Desktop_Linux">The Year Of Linux On The Desktop</a> since at <em>least</em> 2000. I'm not going to be the next one to make grand proclamations (other than "total world domination <em>soon</em>"). But for me... right now, my primary development machines are a 27" iMac running Snow Leopard, and a 15" MacBook Pro, also running Snow Leopard. I won't be upgrading to Lion, and I'll miss the pretty Apple hardware. But when these are ready for replacement... let's just say I really hope <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/7/3006266/dell-project-sputnik-ubuntu-xps-13-developers">Project Sputnik</a> is a huge success for Dell.</p>

<p>Although it's commercial software, targeted toward business users (and consumers) that pays the bills for most of us, I think it's important to remember that the people who make those tools are an important audience, too. I want to see more software of all kinds (web, desktop, and CLI) created by developers, for developers. Preferably open-source tools we can tweak and extend and continue to make better. I think that's my goal for this year, anyhow. I'm going to focus my efforts on projects that make it more fun to be a hacker, whether that's something like making blogging easier, creating build tools, or Linux desktop enhancements that are friendly to those of us who spend most of the day switching between an editor, a shell, and a web browser. I hope others have the same itch, and see the same need, and push back against the disturbing trend of hostility toward open systems and (by extension) the developers who use them.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to the discussion on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/uo2sk/hackers_need_our_own_everything/">this reddit thread</a>, as well as the comments, I made a couple of corrections, particularly re: Duck Duck Go and Gatekeeper. Thanks to everyone who commented.</p>

    <id>http://decomplecting.org/blog/2012/05/29/elegant-organizations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a long time, Jason Fried's article <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html">Why I Run a Flat Company</a> has seemed like an unrealistic dream that only works in rarified pockets of hacker utopia.</p>

<p>You have to understand, I work for an institution which, between the university, hospital(s), and various other divisions, employs over 40k people, enrolls over 20k students, treats countless patients, and who knows how many vendors and contractors add complexity to the mix.</p>

<p>But I still think there's something to this "flat company" idea. My team is a bit of an oddity, and I think that's what allows us to be agile and innovative in a way that's impossible for most of the other software teams. The team is, on an org chart, pretty much flat. We have a team lead, to whom we <em>don't</em> report (on paper).</p>

<p>Let me backtrack a bit. In interest of full disclosure, I do have a bit of a cognitive bias in favor of flat organizations. My lefty politics tend toward anarchist-communism, so I have a certain degree of distrust for <em>any</em> hierarchy. I think this goes back to the important distinction between <em>having</em> authority and <em>being an</em> authority. The difference between a bestowed, arbitrary power, and the innate power of being intelligent, capable, and well-informed.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>From this perspective, the (practical) ideal would be a democratically-managed, worker-owned organization where salaries/wages were ditched in favor of profit sharing.</p>

<p>I think software is one business where this ideal is eminently practicable; but let me get back to "the real world."</p>

<p>Specifically, my job.</p>

<p>On an org chart, it goes CIO -> Sr. Director -> Director -> me. Let me note <em>this is weird</em> for my organization. Normally, it would be something like CIO -> Sr. Director -> Director -> IT Manager -> IT Architect -> Señor Software Engineer -> Software Engineer -> Señor Programmer Analyst (me) and there would likely be some kind of "Peasant Programmer Analyst" for whom I was responsible. I won't go into the fact that if I wrote out what I actually do, it would be 2-3 levels above my pay grade (well, at least not yet).</p>

<p>My team creates enhancements for legacy systems that makes jaws drop among senior VPs from the company that sold us these systems. It's super cool, and after our public release this summer, I'll be able to talk about them. And beleive me, I will. I'm super-proud of this stuff.</p>

<p>But the question remains, how is it we pull this stuff off with 1.4 developers, one sysadmin/network engineer/informal team lead, and one hardware/support guy?</p>

<p>I think the lack of formal management is key. Our director is fairly hands-off, as long as we're meeting goals and keeping the customers satisfied (which we nearly always are). Our team lead recognizes where the real expertise is among the team, and defers to the judgment of the de facto "experts" where appropriate. We are a flat team in an eminently hierarchical organization. And we kick ass.</p>

<p>Recently, our audacious innovation has come onto the radar of the CIO and senior IT management team (among others). That's pretty damn cool, on the one hand. On the other, by being <em>off</em> the radar, we've managed to create this cohesive little unit that actually <em>works.</em> We've also been able to choose a stack based on what will pull off the impossible in a timely fashion, rather than what our approved vendors provide.</p>

<p>We run <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> on most of our production servers. Our web apps are built with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, and there's some <a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby</a> and <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> stuff in the works.</p>

<p>This is unheard of. This in a place where Windows Server is the default, where ASP.NET is the preferred web technology...</p>

<p>I think the problem with having layers and layers of management is that managers need to look like they're <em>doing</em> something. Usually, this invovles purchasing decisions, standards impostion, and adding more layers of inefficient management.</p>

<p>When you have a relatively flat organization, it's more important to hire smart people who can generally handle themselves, set the mat a task, and be ready to support them as necessary. That's how we work, and the result speaks for itself.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>We've experimented with promoting a few people to manager-level roles. In some cases, this has worked out; in others, it hasn't. But one thing we've found is that groups that manage themselves are often better off than groups that are managed by a single person. So when groups do require structure, we get them to manage themselves.</p><footer><strong>Jason Fried,</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html'>www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Of course, innovation isn't <em>always</em> the top priority. But I think whenever possible, it should be towards the very top of the list. Innovation is the key to competitiveness, and whether you're a university, a hospital, or a software company, ultimately it comes down to the bottom line: how do we increase revenues and decrease expenditures?</p>

<p>Creating innovative features that can attract new customers, and save work for staff, at the same time, ultimately mean that deep down, you're a profit center, even if you're still classified by the dreaded beancounters as a cost center. And in this crazy, mixed-up world, that's what it's all about.</p>
